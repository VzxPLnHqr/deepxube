# Requirements

### Python version
This code was tested on Python 3.10.

### Packages
- Deep reinforcement learning: torch>=2.0, numpy
- Visualization: matplotlib, pillow, types-Pillow, imageio
- Logic: clingo
- Data: wget
- Parallel processing: filelock

### Troubleshooting
If installing pytorch (torch>=2.0) is giving you trouble or the installed version of torch is not working with your 
machine, then you can first install torch according to your own requirements (as long as it is >=2.0) and then install 
deepxube.
