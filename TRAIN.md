## Training with Base Environment
To train the heuristic function, state/goal pairs are generated by starting from a given start state and taking random actions to generate a goal state. A goal is then sampled from this goal state.

## Approximate value iteration
Given an environment, approximate value iteration 

## Examples
**Training a heuristic function for the Rubik's cube:**:
```
from deepxube.environments.environment_abstract import Environment
from deepxube.training import avi
from deepxube.utils import env_select

env: Environment = env_select.get_environment("cube3")
avi.train(env, 30, "models/cube3/", batch_size=10000, itrs_per_update=5000, max_itrs=2000000, 
          greedy_update_step_max=30, num_update_procs=48)
```
